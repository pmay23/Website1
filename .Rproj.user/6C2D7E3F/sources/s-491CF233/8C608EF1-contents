# Intro 
 
 For Project 1, I have chosen to split a single dataset in two. The original dataset is called "insurance" obtained from the website Kaggle (source: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance). The data is obtained from a random sample of individuals in the U.S. It contains 3 categorical variables: sex, smoker, and region, and 4 numerical variables: age, bmi, children, and charges. I split the dataset into two separate datasets and re-joined them again using dplyr functions. They were interesting to me because we can observe how different factors such as age, sex, region in the US, and bmi are correlated with insurance monetary charges. Utilizing this information, correlations can be made about insurance costs increasing as age increases, or insurance costs increasing with higher BMI ranges. Potential associations between each variables are many, such as smoker status and number of children, BMI and smoker status, sex and BMI, and more. Ultimately this is why I chose this dataset, because the variables are flexible and can be interpreted in useful ways.  

```{R}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

age_children_smoker_region_charges <- read.csv("/Users/paulaachang/Desktop/R/age_children_smoker_region_charges.csv")
age_sex_bmi <- read.csv("/Users/paulaachang/Desktop/R/age-sex-bmi.csv")
children_smoker_region_charges <- read.csv("/Users/paulaachang/Desktop/R/children-smoker-region-charges.csv")

```

# Tidying

I separated through excel the "insurance" dataset and converted them into "age_sex_bmi" and "children_smoker_region_charges" datasets.


I utilized pivot_wider to spread out "age_sex_bmi" dataset, and then pivot_longer to compile it back together. The same process was repeated for the "children_smoker_region_charges" dataset and in the same order.

```{R}

age_sex_bmi %>% group_by(sex) %>% mutate(row = row_number())%>%pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = bmi) %>% select(-row)%>% replace(is.na(.), 0)%>%glimpse()

wide_asb <- age_sex_bmi %>% group_by(sex) %>% mutate(row = row_number()) %>% tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = bmi) %>% select(-row)%>% replace(is.na(.), 0)%>%glimpse()

gather_asb <- wide_asb %>% pivot_longer(c("female", "male"), names_to = "sex", values_to = "bmi")%>%glimpse()

children_smoker_region_charges %>% group_by(region) %>% mutate(row = row_number()) %>% tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = region, values_from = charges) %>% select(-row)%>% replace(is.na(.), 0)%>%glimpse()

wide_cs <- children_smoker_region_charges %>% group_by(region) %>% mutate(row = row_number()) %>% tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = region, values_from = charges) %>% select(-row)%>% replace(is.na(.), 0)%>%glimpse()

gather_cs <- wide_cs %>% pivot_longer(c("southwest", "southeast", "northwest", "northeast"), names_to = "region", values_to = "charges")%>%glimpse()

```

# Joining/Merging: inner_join

 I chose inner_join to merge "age_sex_bmi" and "children_smoker_region_charges" because it excluded rows and columns where values did not match.
 
```{R}
insurance <- age_sex_bmi %>% inner_join(age_children_smoker_region_charges)%>%glimpse()
```

# Wrangling 

Six core dplyr functions:
```{R}
# filter:
insurance %>% filter(sex=="female")%>%glimpse()
# select: 
insurance %>% select(smoker, charges)%>%glimpse()
# arrange: 
insurance %>% arrange(desc(charges))%>%glimpse()
# group_by: 
insurance %>% group_by(sex)%>%glimpse()
# mutate: 
insurance %>% mutate(bmi_range = case_when(bmi>30 ~ "obese", bmi<18.5 ~ "underweight", 18.6<=bmi & bmi<=24.9 ~ "normal", 25<=bmi & bmi<=29.9 ~ "overweight"))%>%glimpse()
# summarize: 
newinsurance <- insurance %>% mutate(bmi_range = case_when(bmi>30 ~ "obese", bmi<18.5 ~ "underweight", 18.6<=bmi & bmi<=24.9 ~ "normal", 25<=bmi & bmi<=29.9 ~ "overweight"))
newinsurance %>% group_by(bmi_range) %>% summarize(mean_bmi=mean(bmi, na.rm=T))%>%glimpse()

# Summary statistics using numeric variables: age, bmi, charges 
sd(newinsurance$bmi, na.rm=T)%>%glimpse()
var(newinsurance$charges)%>%glimpse()
quantile(newinsurance$age)%>%glimpse()
min(newinsurance$bmi)%>%glimpse()
max(newinsurance$charges)%>%glimpse()
newinsurance%>%n_distinct(newinsurance$age)%>%glimpse()
aggregate(newinsurance$bmi, by = list(Region = newinsurance$region), mean)%>%glimpse()
newinsurance %>% group_by(charges) %>% summarize(mean_age=mean(age, na.rm=T))%>%glimpse()
newinsurance%>% group_by(bmi) %>% summarize(n())%>%glimpse()

# Summary statistics using categorical variables: 
newinsurance %>% group_by(region) %>% summarize(mean_age=mean(age, na.rm=T))
newinsurance %>% group_by(sex, bmi_range) %>% summarize(mean_age=mean(age, na.rm=T)) %>% na.omit()
newinsurance%>% group_by(smoker)%>% summarize(mean_age=mean(age))

#Grouping by 3 categorical variables simultaneously (BMI_range, sex, region):
newinsurance %>% group_by(bmi_range, sex, region) %>% summarize(mean_bmi=mean(bmi, na.rm=T))

#Correlation matrix:
newinsurance %>% select_if(is.numeric) %>% na.omit %>%cor%>%t
#Results: For "age", median age is 35, max 64, min 18. For "BMI", mediam BMI is 30.25, max 53.13, and min 15.96. For "charges", min was $1,122, mean was $12,514 and max $63,770 for this dataset.

# Visualization 
```{R}

# Plot 1: correlation heatmap of numeric variables (age, bmi, charges)
numerics <- newinsurance %>% select_if(is.numeric) %>% select(-children)
correlation <- cor(numerics) %>% as.data.frame %>% rownames_to_column %>% pivot_longer(-1)
correlation %>% ggplot(aes(rowname, name, fill=value)) + geom_tile()+geom_text(aes(label=round(value, 2))) + xlab("") + ylab("")+ scale_fill_gradient2(low="red", high="blue")
# Explanation: We can observe the three variables age, bmi, and charges being plotted against each other in a correlation map. The highest correlations are against the same variables, for example age vs age and charges vs charges. However, we see important differences in the correlation between age and charges (0.3) which is relatively high, compared to bmi and charges (0.03). This is observing the fact that as age increases, charges typically increase as well. Body mass index and charges have a low correlation of 0.03 because body mass index is usually not a good estimator of the amount of insurance charges, therefore are unrelated. Age and BMI have a slightly higher correlation (0.1), higher than the previous comparison, because typically, BMI increases as age increases, so a slight positive correlation is observed in this dataset. None of these correlations are negative, implying that as one variable increases, another decreases. They are all positive correlations and varying in their strength, which the colours from the legend can describe. 

# Plot2
ggplot(newinsurance, aes(x=smoker, y=charges, fill=sex))+geom_bar(stat="identity", outlier.shape=NA)
# This barplot observes three variables, smoker status in the x-axis, cost of insurance in the y-axis, and sex. From the population included in this dataset, we can deduce that smokers incur higher insurance costs than non-smokers, and males typically also incur higher insurance costs. 
# Plot 3
newinsurance %>% ggplot(aes(age, charges, color="pink")) + geom_bar(stat="summary")+ facet_wrap(~region) + scale_x_continuous()
# This plot observes three variables simultaneously: age, charges, and region. Each individual square observes the trend of age vs. charges in that particular region. Overall, most people experience increase in insurance charges with age, but we can also observe how younger individuals in southeastern states in the US have higher charges than the other regions. Individuals included in the study from southwestern region in the U.S. observe lower insurance charges, on average.
