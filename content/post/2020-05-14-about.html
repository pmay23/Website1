<p>Here’s a little bit about my background.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Maracaibo, Venezuela. Now as a 23-yr old American dual citizen, I am grateful to have lived and experienced two different worlds and two completely different life experiences. I miss my home country deeply, but America opened its doors to me and my family as Venezuelan immigrants and it has become my 2nd home. Although it has not been easy to be away from family, I have learned that the best gift that came from moving is meeting new people that can change your life for the best.</p>
<p>On a more random note, quick little facts about me: I love 80’s music of all types, rock, synthpop, alternative, everything and anything coming from the 80’s. I really don’t know why, I just do. I’m also not a picky eater and love to try new foods all the time. Pet peeves: stepping on wet floor with socks on; old toothpaste dried up on sink. Favorite pizza place: Homeslice Pizza. Favorite thing to do in Austin: hiking trail up Barton Creek, taking walks down South Congress, BBQ at Terry Black’s, party in Rainey St, hanging by the Domain, or having brunch at The Oasis by Lake Travis.</p>
<p>On May 23rd, 2020, I will be graduating from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science in Arts in Biology, a huge goal that only I know how hard it took me to achieve. I’m happy to be able to share this accomplishment with my friends and family, and hope to be back in longhorn territory for my master’s sometime in the future.</p>
